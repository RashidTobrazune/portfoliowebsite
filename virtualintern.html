					<p>Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, approached me
						in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about
						KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.

						Particularly, I speak about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket
						Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

						Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The
						organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to
						effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

						However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas
						and she advised that <b>“the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be
							underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to
							use it drive company growth.”</b>

						The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

						Customer Demographic
						Customer Addresses
						Transactions data in the past 3 months
						I decided to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of
						Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.</p>

					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<h3>Goal</h3>
						<p>There were 3 goals in all. The first was to draft an email to the client identifying <b>data
								quality issues</b> and strategies to
							<b>mitigate them</b>.<br>
							The second was to develop a presentation that outlines the approach in targeting new
							customers based on demographics and other attributes.<br>
							The last was to Create a dashboard for the client that specifies who they should be
							targeting in their customer list as well as the broader market segment.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>The report provides actionable recommendations and next steps, supported by solid reasoning.
							It enables informed decision-making, and process improvement.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<h3>What I learnt</h3>
						<p>1. The importance of optimising data quality of customer dataset.<br>
							2. How to target high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.<br>
							3. How visualisations such as interactive dashboards help highlight key findings and convey
							ideas in a succinct manner.</p>

					<hr class="thinline"> <br />
					<h4>1. Data Cleaning</h4>
					<h5>Data quality issues and mitigation</h5>
					Throughout the data analysis process, I encountered certain data quality issues and implemented
					strategies to address them effectively. Additionally, I provided recommendations to prevent these
					issues from recurring, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the data used for making informed business
					decisions.



					1. Customer IDs were found in the 'Transactions' and 'Customer Address' tables that were not present
					in the Customer Demographic' table.
					Mitigation: To maintain consistency, ensure that all tables correspond to the same period, and only
					customers listed in the 'Customer Master' will be used for model training.<br>
					2. Some records contain empty values in columns like brand of purchase or job title.
					Mitigation: Records with a small number of empty fields are filtered out from the training set;
					otherwise, imputation is performed based on the training dataset distribution. <br>

					3. Inconsistent values were observed for the same attribute, such as "QUEENSLAND" represented as
					"QLD”.
					Mitigation: Regular expressions were employed to standardize these values for consistency.
					Recommendation: Implement drop-down lists for data entry to prevent multiple representations of the
					same value. <br>
					4. Gender records labeled as 'U' were replaced with “UNIDENTIFIED”.<br>
					5. Date format were also not same for most. Mitigation: the date format should always be one
					format.<br>
					6. Inconsistent data types were identified for the same attribute, with some fields as numeric
					values and others as strings.
					Mitigation: Selected records were converted from characters to numeric, and non-numeric characters
					were removed from strings.
					<br>
					Recommendation: Ensure that fact tables in the database enforce data type constraints to maintain
					consistency.
					Moving forward, our team will continue with data cleaning, standardization, and transformation for
					model analysis.

					</p>
					<p>
					<h4>2. Data Exploration and Analyzing</h4>
					a. Calculating and examining summary statistics to understand the central tendency and distribution
					of data.
					<br>
					Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables and exploring relationships
					between pairs of variables.
					<br>
					Feature Engineering: Creating new variables or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's
					predictive power.
					<br>
					Data Segmentation: Grouping data based on certain criteria to uncover patterns within specific
					subsets.<br>
					<br> Considering the correlation between independent variables like age and tenure, where
					individuals in older age brackets may exhibit a longer tenure. This process aims to understand how
					variables interrelate and to identify potential correlations that could impact the analysis.

					</p>
					<p>
					<h4>3. Data Visualiztion:</h4>
					After building the model we need to present our results back to the client. Visualisations such as
					interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct
					manner.
					In Power BI and Excel,
					I created graphical representations of the dataset to make it more accessible, reveal patterns, and
					communicate the findings effectively.
					</p>

					<p>
					<h4> Asking Right Questions:</h4> After analyzing the dataset involves asking various questions to
					extract valuable insights based on <br>customers demographics and other attributes.<br>



					</p>
					<p>
					<h5> Interactive Dashboard</h5>
					<img src="images/sprocket.png" alt="sprocket  image" class="image main">
					<img src="images/sprocketdash.png" alt="Dashboard image" class="image main"><br />
					The visualization dashboard crafted for the client serves as a comprehensive guide for targeted
					customer engagement and market segmentation. With 3,999 customers in focus, the dashboard
					encapsulates key insights:

					Total Revenue: Displaying a total revenue of $2,000,000 provides a clear understanding of the
					financial scope.<br>

					Brand Distribution: A breakdown of the seven brands allows the client to discern which brands
					contribute most significantly to revenue and customer engagement.<br>

					Gender Demographics: Highlighting the gender distribution among customers reveals that there are
					more female customers than males, offering valuable insights for tailored marketing strategies.<br>

					Regional Distribution: New South Wales emerges as the region with the highest customer
					concentration, enabling the client to refine targeting strategies for this particular market.<br>

					This visually intuitive dashboard empowers the client to make informed decisions, identify lucrative
					market segments, and optimize their approach for enhanced customer engagement and revenue
					generation.<br>
					<img src="images/10valuecustomers.png" alt="10 customer image" class="image main"><br />
					<img src="images/customername.png" alt="10 Customer image" class="image main"><br />
					In analyzing the dataset, a focus on the top 10 high-value customers unveils critical insights for strategic decision-making. These customers, characterized by their significant contribution to revenue, represent a lucrative segment deserving special attention.
					<br>Exploring the demographics of these top customers, such as gender, age, or location, enables the client to tailor marketing campaigns more precisely.
					By focusing on the top 10 high-value customers, the client can strategically allocate resources, and enhance customer satisfaction, ultimately driving sustained revenue growth.
					<br />And with that, I conclude this exercise. As mentioned earlier, this was a valuable opportunity
					to assess and enhance my skills. Thank you for your engagement.
