					<span class="image main"><img src="images/netflixresize.png" alt="Netflix Image" /></span>
					<p>Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and
						original contents.The data consist of contents added to Netflix approximately from 1960 to 2021.
						I retreived the dataset free from an online data community platform <i>kaggle.</i> This dataset
						was cleaned with <b>MySQL</b> and visualized with <b>Power BI </b>. The purpose of this dataset
						was to test my <b>data cleaning</b> and <b>visualization</b> skills.</p>

					<p></p>
				</div>
				<div class="row rmarg">
					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<h3>Goal</h3>
						<p>The goal was to clean and visualize the dataset to provide relevant insights, asking the
							right questions and analyzing the data for better decision-making.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>The report provides actionable recommendations and next steps, supported by solid reasoning.
							It enables informed decision-making, and process improvement.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<h3>Skill Utilization</h3>
						<p>This project demonstrates a robust skill utilization, where SQL was used for data preparation and transformation, while Power BI was employed for data visualization and deriving meaningful insights. The seamless integration of these skills contributed to a comprehensive and actionable data analysis for this dataset.</p>

					<hr class="thinline"> <br />
					<h4>1. Data Cleaning</h4>
					I performed several important data preparation and transformation steps when analyzing this Netflix
					dataset using SQL commands with MySQL.<br /> Let's break down some part of what I did:<br /><br />


					a. Treated Duplicates: Duplicates in the data could have skewed the analysis. I used <b>'HAVING'</b>
					and <b>'COUNT'</b> statements<br /> to identify and remove duplicate rows based on one or more
					columns.<br />
					<!--<img src="images/dupli.jpg" alt="Duplicates statement image">--><br />


					b. Treated Nulls: Handling null values is crucial. I used the <b>'IS NULL'</b> and <b>'FILTER'</b>
					statement to identify<br /> and potentially replace null values in the dataset. <br />
					<br />
					c. Populated Missing Rows: I created and populated missing rows to ensure the dataset is complete
					and accurate. <br />I used some statements like <b>'UPDATE'</b>, <b>'SET</b>, <b>'WHERE'</b> to
					insert missing data, replacing unambiguous values with 'Not given'.<br />
					It helped me assessed the quality of the dataset by checking for inconsistencies, data entry errors
					that might affect the integrity of the data.

					</p>
					<p>
					<h4>2. Data Exploration and Analyzing</h4>
					a. Using COUNTROWS and FILTER in DAX: In Power BI, I used the basic DAX language to create custom
					calculations and measures. I used <b>'COUNTROWS'</b> function to count the number of rows in a table
					or a table expression, and <b>'FILTER'</b> for filtering data based on specified conditions. I
					performed more calculations and filter data as needed for the analysis.
					<br /><br />
					It is important to note that a typical data analysis process involves several other steps, such as
					data exploration, data visualization, and deriving insights.
					I applied transformations, such as scaling numerical features, and creating new measures based on
					domain knowledge.

					</p>
					<p>
					<h4>3. Data Visualiztion:</h4>
					In Power BI,
					I created graphical representations of the dataset to make it more accessible, reveal patterns, and
					communicate the findings effectively. I used line charts, bar charts, Map, tree map, and pie chart.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h4> Asking Right Questions:</h4> Analyzing a Netflix dataset involves asking various questions to extract valuable insights. <br>Here are some key questions I asked myself to guide my analysis:<br>

						What are the most prevalent genres and categories of content on Netflix?<br>
						Which directors or producers have the most content available on the platform?<br>
						What is the distribution of content based on release year?<br>
						Can we identify target demographics for specific types of content?<br>
						Demographics with highest movies on netflix.<br>
						Which  viewer ratings has the highest content or popularity scores?<br>
						Are there specific genres that tend to lower content?<br>

					<img src="images/vizmain.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main">
					<img src="images/moviereleyr.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main"><br />
					This chart shows that for almost a decade, the number of content added to Netflix varies each year,
					either increasing or decreasing.
					In 2018, 1146 content were added and it decreased to 592 in 2021.
					It also shows the year with most contents, which was 2018.
					Slicers could have been used to filter for content added per month if it was given in dataset.

					The chart provides insight into the five prominent directors who have their content featured on
					Netflix. It has also shown directors who have made a significant impact on the platform with their
					contributions to
					the world of film and entertainment. This
					information can be used to award them .<br><br>

					<h5>4(a). Top 10 Directors based on Movie and Tv show</h5>
					<img src="images/vizmain.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main">
					<img src="images/bymovishow.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main"><br />

					<h5>4(b). Bottom Directors based Movie and Tv show</h5>

					<img src="images/botom.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main"><br />
					This also directors with least content on aNetflix.<br><br/>

					<h5> 5. Ratings of Content(Movie and Tv show)</h5>
					<img src="images/vizmain.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main">
					<img src="images/toprate.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main"><br />
					Ratings are a crucial system used to gauge the appropriateness of a motion picture for specific
					audiences, taking into account its content. In this chart, we highlight the highest-rated content on
					Netflix.

					A noteworthy observation is that the majority of content on Netflix carries a TV-MA rating. In the
					United States, the TV-MA rating, as defined by the TV Parental Guidelines, indicates content
					intended for Mature Audiences. It signifies that the material may be unsuitable for children under
					17, containing elements such as strong language, explicit content, and intense violence. This rating
					serves as a vital indicator for viewers seeking content tailored to more mature sensibilities.
					<br>
<br/>

					<h5> 6. Release years with highest Contents</h5>
					<img src="images/vizmain.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main">
					<img src="images/yrhighcon.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main"><br />
					This chart illustrates the years in which Netflix released the highest number of movies and TV
					shows. We've specifically focused on the top 10 release years or production years.

					What's evident is that from 2012 to 2018, Netflix consistently added a substantial amount of recent
					content, ensuring that the quantity of recent releases per year outpaced older releases. However, in
					2019 and the later years, there was a noticeable decline. While this decline might be attributed to
					the impact of
					Covid-19, further analysis would be required to confirm this hypothesis.<br><br/>

					<h5> 7. Number of Content based on Genre</h5>
					<img src="images/vizmain.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main">
					<img src="images/genre.png" alt="Movietype percentage image" class="image main"><br />
					The chart displays the most prevalent genres on Netflix.
					It's evident that Drama and International movies, closely followed by Documentary, dominate the
					content offerings on Netflix within the given timeframe.
					It also tells which genre needs to be added or removed in the future.<br />

					<br />And with that, I conclude this exercise. As mentioned earlier, this was a valuable opportunity
					to assess and enhance my skills. Thank you for your engagement.
